            <p class="blog-post-meta" >2021-01-03</p>
            <p>Benjamin Franklin was in many ways an excellent role model for future generations of his new nation: a marketing expert, practical engineer, and a skilled negotiator with sense for compromise.</p>

<p><a href="/theme/images/1*8pd7aWqA7IK2ZqTKBYJFlQ.jpeg.png"><img src="/theme/images/1*8pd7aWqA7IK2ZqTKBYJFlQ.jpeg.png" alt="Book cover: Benjamin Franklin by Walter Isaacson" style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"></a>
<ul><li>Franklin was a printer by training and later a newspaper publisher. Many newspaper articles were written using pseudonyms and newspapers arguably read as modern social media. Therefore it is not surprising that Franklin was considered the most <a href="https://www.mountvernon.org/library/digitalhistory/digital-encyclopedia/article/benjamin-franklin/" target="_blank">admired and famous founding father</a> by some</li></ul>
<ul><li>Retired from business in 1748 to focus on public service full time. He was often direct when speaking about politicians: “He wished to please everybody, and having little to give, he gave expectations”</li></ul>
<ul><li>He established many public institutions including libraries and what we know today as the University of Pennsylvania</li></ul>
<ul><li>The only man to sign the key documents codifying the creation of the United States: Declaration of Independence, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1783)" target="_blank">Treaty of Paris</a>, and the Constitution</li></ul>
<ul><li>Franklin spent many years living in Europe. He moved to London for 2 years as a <a href="https://www.ushistory.org/franklin/info/timeline.htm" target="_blank">young printer in 1724</a> and then as a US representative during the struggle for <a href="https://www.ushistory.org/franklin/info/timeline2.htm" target="_blank">independence starting in 1757</a>. In 1776 he moved to France to represent US interests with its key ally</li></ul>
<ul><li>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Franklin’s character was his ability to change his mind and convince others of his newly conflicting opinions. Franklin initially supported the Stamp Act of 1765, by which the British Parliament levied a new tax on British colonies. When Franklin learned of strong opposition in America he changed his views</li></ul>
<ul><li>Franklin was not a theoretical thinker who generated his best work purely by thinking deeply <a href="https://adamnovotny.com/blog/einstein-by-walter-isaacson.html" target="_blank">the way Einstein did</a>. Instead, he had an excellent engineering mind that allowed him to connect the dots. He connected both <a href="https://www.amphilsoc.org/about" target="_blank">people</a> and ideas to create <a href="https://www.fi.edu/benjamin-franklin/inventions" target="_blank">inventions</a></li></ul></p>
