            <p>Walter Isaacson dedicates most of the book to describing Einstein’s life, politics and the nature of his creativity. The fact that he spends much less time focusing on physics is perhaps not surprising given his target audience. This differs from similar books such as Robert Oppenheimer by Ray Monk or American Prometheus by Bird and Sherwin where physics plays a larger role. Below is list of fascinating ideas from Isaacson’s depiction of Einstein’s life:</p>

<p><a href="/theme/images/1*wHZ0bWo4YaLS_-het6t7oA.png.png"><img src="/theme/images/1*wHZ0bWo4YaLS_-het6t7oA.png.png" alt="Einstein by Walter Isaacson book cover" style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"></a>
<ul><li>Einstein did his best work when working as a patent examiner outside of academia. In fact, he failed to get a job in academia for a long time</li></ul>
<ul><li>Folklore describing Einstein as a bad student isn’t true. Einstein was nonconformist and questioned educational methods but school never challenged him intellectually: “The value of a college education is not the learning of many facts but the training of the mind to think … A society’s competitive advantage will come not from how well its schools teach the multiplication and periodic tables, but from how well they stimulate imagination and creativity.”</li></ul>
<ul><li>He was a citizen of 3 countries: Germany, Switzerland, USA but spent the second part of his life denouncing Germany. He hated nationalism and conflict</li></ul>
<ul><li>Love/hate relationship with politics. As a Jew forced to leave Germany due to safety concerns, Einstein was naturally involved in public life. However, he also acknowledged the futility of such efforts: “Politics is for the present, while our equations are for eternity.”</li></ul>
<ul><li>Rather than trying to explain physics, Isaacson avoided the risk by relying of Einstein’s contemporaries making the field sound too complex. Weizmann, the president of the World Zionist Organization, said the following about his time spent with Einstein: “During the [Atlantic] crossing, Einstein explained his theory [of relativity] to me every day, and by the time we arrived I was fully convinced that he really understands it.”</li></ul>
<ul><li>Einstein helped to spearhead the development of the Atom bomb. After the war he became a very strong opponent: “I do not know how the Third World War will be fought, but I can tell you what they will use in the Fourth — rocks”</li></ul>
