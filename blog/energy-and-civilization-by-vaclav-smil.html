            <p class="blog-post-meta" >2021-03-13</p>
            <p>This book appeared on my radar after hearing that <a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Energy-and-Civilization" target="_blank">Bill Gates recommended</a> it and he describes Smil as one of his favorite authors. The content didn’t disappoint mainly due to in depth research and a variety of fascinating facts and estimates.</p>

<ul><li>The book covers all the main dominating energy sources that propelled human development</li></ul>
<ul><li>Fossil fules began to displace biomass as early as the 1650 in England when coal became the dominant source of energy. It took until the 19th century for other countries to catch up, allowing Britain to become a superpower due to coal’s higher energy density</li></ul>
<ul><li>Global biomass fuel consumption was about 280 megatonnes of oil equivalent in 1700 and 2,500 in 2000, increasing nearly 10 fold in 300 years. In the same time frame, fossil fuel extraction grew from 20 megatonnes to 8,100 megatonnes, a 400x increase</li></ul>
<ul><li>Fossil fuel utilization improved with the invention of the steam engine (and in next generations the the internal combustion engine, steam turbine, and gas turbine)</li></ul>
<ul><li>Between 1820 and 2010 the energy consumption in the United States rose from 70 to above 300 GJ per capita</li></ul>
<ul><li>The human brain consumes 20–25% of resting metabolic energy, compared to 8–10% in other primates and just 3–5% in other mammals</li></ul>
<ul><li>Nuclear power is underutilized. It produces about 20% of U.S. electricity. Even as newly designed nuclear plants have been shown to be incredibly safe, there are almost no plans to build new plants. The political will and financing evaporated (perhaps with the exception of France)</li></ul>
<a href="/theme/images/1*lyqYjfSWSsBAgc_QvmGNHQ.png.png"><img src="/theme/images/1*lyqYjfSWSsBAgc_QvmGNHQ.png.png" alt="% of energy generated by nuclear power by country" style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"></a>
<ul><li>“When in 1900 a Great Plains farmer held the reins of six large horses while plowing his wheat field, he controlled … no more than 5 kW of animate power. A century later his great-grandson, sitting high above the ground in the air-conditioned comfort of his tractor cabin, controlled effortlessly more than 250 kW of diesel engine power.”</li></ul>
<ul><li>“The food supply in affluent countries is now 75% higher than actual need, resulting in enormous food waste (30–40% of all food at the retail level)”</li></ul>
<ul><li>“A medium-heavy horse weighing 750kg and delivering one horsepower (745 W) will have a mass/power ration of almost exactly 1,000 g/W…..in 1984 a new Daimler-Maybach gasoline engine ….. rated less than 30 g/W”</li></ul>
<ul><li>Germany derived 84% of its energy needs from fossil fuels in 2000. Then it started a major campaign building 90 gigawatts of renewable power capacity, enough to match its existing electricity generation. However, due to lack of sun exposure in 2017 fossil fuel still supplied 80% of the country’s energy</li></ul></p>
