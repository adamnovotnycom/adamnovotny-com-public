            <p>Genome is fascinating science fiction book focused on what could be hidden in human Genome. <a href="https://www.agriddle.com/Genome" target="_blank">The book’s website</a> has an interesting section explaining which of main themes are fact vs fiction. Below is a selection of 3 facts I found interesting.</p>

<h4>Icebreaker</h4>
<p>The exploratory ship at the beginning of the book of based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_22220_icebreaker" target="_blank">Russian Project 22220</a>, the largest nuclear-powered icebreaker designed.</p>
<h4>The Quaternary Extinction Event</h4>
<p>“The Quaternary extinction was a mass die-off of large animals that occurred during the transition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene epoch (13,000 BCE to 8,000 BCE). The extinction is believed to have been caused by two factors. The first was natural climate change on a global scale, specifically the end of the last glacial period, known popularly as the last ice age. Technically speaking, we’re still in an ice age, one that has lasted millions of years — we’re just in an interglacial period at the moment. At the time of the Quaternary extinction, the warming of the planet and retreating glaciers put many species at risk. Large animals that had evolved for cold weather died out, and those that survived fell prey to humans invading their environment”</p>
<h4>Europe’s Colonization of Asia</h4>
<p>“In July of 1405, a Chinese fleet under the command of Zheng He departed from Suzhou for a tour around the Pacific Ocean. The scale of the expedition was massive. Over three hundred ships, almost twenty-eight thousand crewmen, mostly military. They visited much of Southeast Asia, including Brunei, Java, and Thailand. They stopped in India, the Horn of Africa, and Arabia.</p>
<p>China in 1405 was home to sixty-five million people. England had only two million. China was the largest economy in the world at that time. India was second. And the Chinese fleets were much more advanced than those of any European power. Their largest ship was four hundred feet long and had a four-tiered deck. By comparison, Christopher Columbus’s largest ship, the Santa María, was roughly fifty-eight feet long.”</p>
