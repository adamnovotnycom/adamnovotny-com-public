            <p>Skin in the Game is a curious collection of anecdotes that has to make everyone question the fairness of modern society. A short subset of interesting thoughts is below:</p>

<p><a href="/theme/images/1*STVayKpah-JBAsfYqGfYtQ.png.png"><img src="/theme/images/1*STVayKpah-JBAsfYqGfYtQ.png.png" alt="Skin in the Game by Nassim Nicholas Taleb" style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"></a>
<ul><li>Bureaucracy is a construction by which a person is conveniently separated from the consequences of their actions</li></ul>
<ul><li>You will never fully convince someone that he is wrong; only reality can. The curse of modernity is that we are increasingly populated by a class of people who are better at explaining than understanding … or better at explaining than doing</li></ul>
<ul><li>Hammurabi’s code: If a builder builds a house and the house collapses and causes the death of the owner of the hours — the builder shall be put to death</li></ul>
<ul><li>Skin in the game vs. no skin in the game. Bureaucrats vs citizens. Consultants vs businessmen. Executives vs Entrepreneurs. Copy editors vs writers. Journalists vs speculators</li></ul>
<ul><li>Journalists should talk about what they own (stocks). Instead under the promise of impartiality, they talk about what they don’t own and therefore most likely don’t understand</li></ul>
<ul><li>Society doesn’t move by consensus: only a few motivated people are enough to disproportionately move the needle</li></ul>
<ul><li>Ronald Coase: An employee is - by design - more valuable inside a firm than outside of it; that is, more valuable to the employer than the marketplace</li></ul>
<ul><li>Only time validates expertise. The longer an idea has been around without being falsified, the longer its future expectancy</li></ul>
<ul><li>Time-tested ideas: cognitive dissonance (people rationalize inconsistent beliefs), loss aversion, negative advice (we know the wrong better than the right), skin in the game, antifragility, time discounting, madness of crowds, less is more, overconfidence, the Paradox of Progress</li></ul>
<ul><li>Hire, conditionally on an equal set of skills, the person with the least label-oriented education. The person had to overcome more hurdles</li></ul>
<ul><li>Economic insecurity in journalism means that journalists have to produce the most popular opinion to sell their product to the crowds. In business, the opposite is true and following the crowd is penalized</li></ul>
<ul><li>Bible: “Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of others to be seen by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven. So when you give to the needy, do not announce it with trumpets, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets, to be honored by others”</li></ul>
<ul><li>Mathematicians think in objects and relations, jurists and legal thinkers in constructs, logicians in maximally abstract operators, and … fools in words</li></ul>
<ul><li>Atheistic Soviet Communism: all-embracing control over all of human activity and thought, which makes discussions about whether religion or atheistic regimes are more murderous lacking in pertinence, precision, and realism</li></ul>
<ul><li>Ergodicity, ruin: play Russian roulette with $1M payout. The average return is 5/6 * $1M = $833k according to classical cost/benefit analysis. However, continue playing and you end up in the cemetery. The expected return is not computable</li></ul>
