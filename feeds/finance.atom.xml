&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty around the virus is still high and vaccine seems to be &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-vaccine/art-20484859" target="_blank"&gt;12–18 months&lt;/a&gt; away. The closest region approaching herd immunity is &lt;a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-announces-results-completed-antibody-testing" target="_blank"&gt;NYC with 20%&lt;/a&gt; spread of the virus among the population. But that is nowhere near herd immunity requirements. “&lt;a href="https://www.discovermagazine.com/health/is-herd-immunity-our-best-weapon-against-covid-19" target="_blank"&gt;Experts predict at least 70 percent of the population will need to be immune to the virus in order to achieve herd immunity.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most economics charts worldwide have “broken” websites because y-axes do not reach low enough. Such is the extend of the ongoing economic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Global PMI: &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/world-economic-indicators-dashboard/" target="_blank"&gt;39.8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;German Ifo: &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/world-economic-indicators-dashboard/" target="_blank"&gt;74.3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leading indicator of health in the euro area’s largest economy based on a survey of ~7,000 executives in German manufacturing, services, retail, wholesale and construction companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;How do we make sense of the stock market’s optimistic behavior during these strong headwinds?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only 2 unconvincing answers that come to mind:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stock markets are forward-looking and all the damage of the virus is behind us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;FED can support the markets indefinitely by buying everything publicly traded using printed money. The following &lt;a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL" target="_blank"&gt;chart&lt;/a&gt; shows the FEDs assets currently sitting at $6,934,227,000,000, or $6.9T, which have “broken” the y-axis in the opposite direction.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/theme/images/1*NDl-1RICjp9jP-AEW6yeCg.png.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/theme/images/1*NDl-1RICjp9jP-AEW6yeCg.png.png" alt="Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (US). Total Assets. Retrieved from FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis; https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL, May 16, 2020." style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first explanation suggest that there are many brave people betting against the virus. The second suggests that future inflation will never become a factor. Neither is convincing.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Finance"></category></entry><entry><title>The Real Divide: Those Who Are Not Allowed to Work</title><link href="https://adamnovotny.com/blog/the-real-divide-those-who-are-not-allowed-to-work.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-05-09T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-05-09T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Adam Novotny</name></author><id>tag:adamnovotny.com,2020-05-09:/blog/the-real-divide-those-who-are-not-allowed-to-work.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;With the employment rate in the US jumping to alarming &lt;a href="https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/unemployment-rate" target="_blank"&gt;14.7%&lt;/a&gt; from less than 4% in just one quarter, the COVID-19 crisis has created a gap between those who are allowed to work, and those who are not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/theme/images/1*jIsZ9NrYpyAtH4Vy4Gl3DQ.png.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/theme/images/1*jIsZ9NrYpyAtH4Vy4Gl3DQ.png.png" alt="Industry classification by job security during the COVID crisis" style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When people talk about inequality, they typically discuss absolute wealth levels as a point in time. This is similar as looking at a company’s balance sheet. However, I’ll argue that looking at a person’s freedom to continue working is more important. Not unlike looking at a company’s cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I classified industries into 4 quadrants depending whether they are mission critical to maintain our standard of living and whether they require physical presence of employees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the low end in terms of job security are jobs where employees cannot work remotely. Also when they do not come to work modern society remains relatively intact. These include hair salons and bars.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Next we have jobs that can be done remotely but again, the products are sometimes more of a luxury rather than a necessity. These include many types of internet businesses. Even Google with its tens of billions in cash and no debt is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222942/google-slowing-down-hiring-through-2020-covid-19-pandemic" target="_blank"&gt;“significantly slowing down hiring”&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then we have industries such as airlines which are absolutely critical for the maintenance of our standard of living, but they require physical presence of both employees and customers. These industries are heavily impacted because many trips are not essential. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-04-24/coronavirus-travel-covid-19-will-change-airlines-and-how-we-fly" target="_blank"&gt;Airlines find themselves with extreme levels of overcapacity&lt;/a&gt; as customers reassess their travel needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lastly, some jobs are essential and yet they do not require employees’ physical presence. These include analytical jobs in national security or &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/06/why-you-should-take-advantage-of-your-telemedicine-options.html" target="_blank"&gt;telemedicine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/theme/images/1*_7W4swGJ2COrBH2YIXk82w.png.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/theme/images/1*_7W4swGJ2COrBH2YIXk82w.png.png" alt="Parked airplanes due to COVID-19" style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People need to start thinking about inequality in terms of flow of wealth rather than accumulation. People whose flow of income is forcibly cut face life-altering events such as evictions, permanent negotiations with creditors, and limits on their &lt;a href="https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/credit-score-gap-widens-for-mortgage-borrowers/" target="_blank"&gt;future access to resources&lt;/a&gt;. Paying my mortgage this month is more important than expensive clothes in my closet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Update 6/13/2020&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A related consequence is that working hours and wealth have become more correlated. This is well explained in the Making Sense podcast by Sam Harriss and his guest Daniel Markovits in their episode titled &lt;a href="https://samharris.org/podcasts/205-failure-meritocracy/" target="_blank"&gt;The Failure of Meritocracy&lt;/a&gt;. Wealthier people are more likely to work longer hours because their professions allow for multiple working environments, all of which further worsens inequality.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Finance"></category></entry><entry><title>Free Healthcare Is Free Markets</title><link href="https://adamnovotny.com/blog/free-healthcare-is-free-markets.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-25T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-04-25T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Adam Novotny</name></author><id>tag:adamnovotny.com,2020-04-25:/blog/free-healthcare-is-free-markets.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Healthy people lead to more competition, not less.

Free basic healthcare leads to more capitalism which some supporters of free markets seem to misunderstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/theme/images/1*LsM2ZEBc5cltUyuq0pOS0w.png.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/theme/images/1*LsM2ZEBc5cltUyuq0pOS0w.png.png" alt="Waterfalls" style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs innovate in the economy because of their willingness to work hard AND because they are physically able. A young entreprenuer’s career in the US could be permanently damaged if she is diagnosed with cancer. The fear of reoccurrence and financial ruin could result her giving up on her dreams andtaking a steady, but much less impactful corporate job with a healthcare plan. This behavior occurs daily and it permanently damages the economy and therefore everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market-based healthcare also creates inefficiencies at the worst possible time. During the COVID-19 crisis, US states engaged in a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/09/why-states-and-the-federal-government-are-bidding-on-ppe.html" target="_blank"&gt;bidding war against each other to obtain basic medical equipment&lt;/a&gt;. There is no reason why a resident of a wealthier US state should have access to more life-saving equipment. This ultimate hurts everyone: patients, tax payers, and most importantly the hospital workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there needs to be a way to ensure that people who intentionally harm themselves are not subsidized to do so. Smokers who develop lung cancer need to pay for their coverage in full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/theme/images/1*Riw51hOHOmP6efnOqXOYAg.jpeg.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/theme/images/1*Riw51hOHOmP6efnOqXOYAg.jpeg.png" alt="Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine" style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of the traditional methods of imposing statism or socialism on a people has been by way of medicine. It’s very easy to disguise a medical program as a humanitarian project, most people are a little reluctant to oppose anything that suggests medical care for people who possibly can’t afford it.” ~ &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan_Speaks_Out_Against_Socialized_Medicine" target="_blank"&gt;Ronald Reagan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a strong supporter of free market economics. I believe that the economic motivation is the primary reason why people take risks, employ others, innovate, and make everyone around them wealthier. But free basic healthcare is not the same thing as a free Ferrari. It is not the same as wealthy parents giving their spoiled kids free yachts. What Reagan suggests is that free basic healthcare is a form of communist indoctrination. Others suggest that free basic healthcare would strip people of their economic motivation to work hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free basic healthcare doesn’t make people more or less motivated. No one has ever started a business or new careers because of their motivation to pay for healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free basic healthcare just levels the playing field so that everyone can compete, which is what free markets are all about.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Finance"></category></entry><entry><title>What I No Longer Believe</title><link href="https://adamnovotny.com/blog/what-i-no-longer-believe.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-18T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-04-18T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Adam Novotny</name></author><id>tag:adamnovotny.com,2020-04-18:/blog/what-i-no-longer-believe.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I used to believe that optimizing for efficiency should be the main goal of modern economies.

&lt;p&gt;If there is one lesson to be taken from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019" target="_blank"&gt;COVID-19 crisis&lt;/a&gt;, it is the reminder that human life is an external system vulnerable to adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is not a computer game and how things go wrong is not easy to model due to the complex correlations of the physical world. Manufacturing everything in China may be the most efficient under ideal circumstances. But when things go wrong, they go wrong at the same time. Air freight prices increased &lt;a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2020/03/24/air-freight-prices-surging-amid-covid19/" target="_blank"&gt;increased by 100+% because of no capacity of passenger flights&lt;/a&gt; which are all grounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So efficient manufacturing works if logistics works but now logistics is failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries lacking manufacturing capacity (such USA and most of Europe) need to focus on resiliency. This should be done by paying what I call “manufacturing insurance”. In other words, countries should pay slightly higher prices for &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/05/811387424/face-masks-not-enough-are-made-in-america-to-deal-with-coronavirus" target="_blank"&gt;essential items such as face masks manufactured locally&lt;/a&gt;. This will insure countries against expensive shocks later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the race towards efficiency, western governments saved pennies on masks early to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/03/26/821457551/whats-inside-the-senate-s-2-trillion-coronavirus-aid-package" target="_blank"&gt;pay trillions later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Finance"></category></entry><entry><title>On government-run capitalism</title><link href="https://adamnovotny.com/blog/on-government-run-capitalism.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-04-11T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-04-11T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Adam Novotny</name></author><id>tag:adamnovotny.com,2020-04-11:/blog/on-government-run-capitalism.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ever since the financial crisis, it has become clear that the value of companies is linked with the willingness of governments to bail them out.

&lt;p&gt;In 2020 the covid crisis sheds additional light on the issue. No matter how poorly run a company is, it will receive unlimited funds if it employs enough people or can be considered important to national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes even less sense is that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/12/20/789540931/2-years-later-trump-tax-cuts-have-failed-to-deliver-on-gops-promises" target="_blank"&gt;corporate taxes have been decreasing in the US&lt;/a&gt;. As long as the bailout culture remains, taxes should be high because they become a form of insurance against future bailouts. Currently, bailouts and low tax rates are the ultimate wealth transfer from younger generations to the older.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Eurozone is not sleeping behind the wheel either. The single market has strict rules against government subsidies to allow companies from all countries to compete freely. But these have been suspended as governments spray their economies with $2.2 trillion of support. Germany spent 50% of that amount propping up its businesses. This becomes absurdly anti-competitive if you consider the disadvantage of companies from poorer countries if their governments cannot afford similar subsidies. What’s the point of having rules if they are paused during every crisis?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In capitalism, companies are valuable if they make efficiently something that people want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That pure equation making capitalism valuable no longer applies. Big business maintains its status by colluding with government to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;remove competitors (example Facebook, see &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/opinion/sunday/chris-hughes-facebook-zuckerberg.html" target="_blank"&gt;article by co-founder Chris Hughes&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;become systemically important by claiming national security or high employment status resulting in government-financed &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Put_option" target="_blank"&gt;puts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In either case, capitalism is dead. Welcome to government-run capitalism fueled by moral hazard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month has marked the 10th anniversary of the global financial crisis of 2008 and media raced to discuss the &lt;a href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/09/06/the-world-has-not-learned-the-lessons-of-the-financial-crisis" target="_blank"&gt;lessons (not) learned&lt;/a&gt;. In reality, the only lesson learned is that the largest financial institutions must be bailed out at all costs to keep the current financial system afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below I review some of the main causes of the 2008 financial crisis and comment on what we have learned in the past 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Too Big To Fail&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an ideal world, every sector of the economy would be subject to Joseph Schumpeter’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Destruction&lt;/a&gt;. Economies improve the lives of citizens when businesses can be readily replaced by more efficient and innovative competitors. Unfortunately, this rule not apply to the financial system today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creative destruction cannot happen as long the financial system remains as interconnected as it has been. Just once did regulators in the US attempt to use tough love and punish bankers in 2008. Debating whether or not large banks should be allowed to go bankrupt, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_Lehman_Brothers" target="_blank"&gt;Lehman was allowed to declare bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt; with no clear plans for its future. This was a miserable failure. The wave of uncertainty in the next few days resulted the need for the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Recovery_and_Reinvestment_Act_of_2009" target="_blank"&gt;largest bailout&lt;/a&gt; ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial system is not just &lt;a href="https://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/the-critical-difference-between-complex-and-complicated/" target="_blank"&gt;complicated, it is complex&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, the regulators understood that the complexity of the system means that no stone should be left unturned when saving it. The confusing part of this lesson is that the key regulators in the 2008 financial crisis now argue that some tools they used to save the financial system would &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/07/opinion/sunday/bernanke-lehman-anniversary-oped.html" target="_blank"&gt;no longer be available to them today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems clear that the system would have to change completely before the 2008 tools are taken away from regulators. However, the system has not been changed. Let’s compare the 2007 and 2018 market capitalization of the 10 largest US financial institutions according to &lt;a href="https://us.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-500-financials-sector" target="_blank"&gt;S&amp;P 500 Financials&lt;/a&gt; sector index:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/theme/images/1*Dx18Ux6VgT-1yuDXRK-kKg.png.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/theme/images/1*Dx18Ux6VgT-1yuDXRK-kKg.png.png" alt="Market capitalization of the top 10 S&amp;P 500 Financials" style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, the table is only a very rough estimate of the impact of the largest financial institutions on the economy. Market cap does not directly relate to the impact on the economy but it’s a good rough estimate. Some companies were removed from the index so their impact diminished (Lehman’s market cap in 2007 reached $60bn but today it’s 0). General inflation also causes some of the growth. However, considering the significant growth of the value of these companies from 2007 to 2018, it’s impossible to argue that large financials are less important to the state of the economy today than they were in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Low Interest Rates &amp; Mortgages&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another logical cause of the financial crisis were low interest rates between 2002–2006. Ever since Paul Volcker, FED Chairman, used interest rates to &lt;a href="https://www.thebalance.com/who-is-paul-volcker-3306157" target="_blank"&gt;eliminate double digit inflation in early 1980s&lt;/a&gt;, interest rates have become the most favorite tool of central bankers to influence the economy. High interest rates lead to slow downs of economies and inflation, and low interest rates have the opposite effect. The consensus about the significant impact of central bankers is so strong that their &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/central-bankers-jackson-hole-gathering-a-cheat-sheet-1535068873" target="_blank"&gt;annual gathering in Jackson Hole&lt;/a&gt; has become legendary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/theme/images/1*OFnvoEtJeI7TCwlOVntIWQ.png.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/theme/images/1*OFnvoEtJeI7TCwlOVntIWQ.png.png" alt="Effective Federal Funds Rate" style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low interest rates incentivize companies and individuals to borrow (for example in the form of mortgages) which stimulates economic growth. After 9/11, interest rates were lowered to around 1% to stimulate growth and resulted in the excessive, irresponsible borrowing &lt;a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/central-banks-mistakes-low-interest-rates-hurting-the-global-economy-2015-9" target="_blank"&gt;many argue became one of the primary causes of the 2008 financial crisis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether this argument is true is still open to debate. What is not open to debate is that if extremely low interest rate kept for too long are harmful, then we have not learned the lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/theme/images/1*g4kSFkFGtk7dcyCWBXIEsg.png.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/theme/images/1*g4kSFkFGtk7dcyCWBXIEsg.png.png" alt="30-Year Fixed Rate Mortgage Average in the United States" style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage rates reflect general interest rates so rates between 2001–2006 were at historically lowest levels at the time. This led people to borrow too much for properties they couldn’t afford. And that is how the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subprime_mortgage_crisis_solutions_debate" target="_blank"&gt;subprime mortgage crisis&lt;/a&gt; unfolded. However, mortgage rates have now been lower for over a decade compared to those supposedly causing the crisis. Financial institutions presumably increased lending standards to ensure that only people in good financial standings can borrow. However, even this obvious lesson is &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ex-citimortgage-ceo-3-things-i-learned-from-the-2008-great-financial-crisis-2018-09-17" target="_blank"&gt;now being tested&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Accountability and Ethics&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fractional banking means that confidence of the population in the financial system is paramount. It’s not just paramount, it’s the only thing there is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public perception is that there were no people made responsible for 2008 crisis. When the music stopped for&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal" target="_blank"&gt; Enron&lt;/a&gt; or later &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madoff_investment_scandal" target="_blank"&gt;Madoff&lt;/a&gt;, people responsible landed jail sentences totaling hundreds of years. However, no such cases took place following the 2008 financial crisis even though many &lt;a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/business/german-bank-sues-goldman-sachs-over-toxic-mortgage-losses-6521591.html" target="_blank"&gt;lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; were filled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, education has not kept up either because some students are concerned that &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06608-6" target="_blank"&gt;economics is being taught as if no financial crisis&lt;/a&gt; happened. Imagine an architect designing a bridge which subsequently falls down but students continue being taught to build the same bridges in schools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Criminal cases must be decided beyond any reasonable doubt so it is conceivable that the complexity of the financial system means that no people can be made directly responsible for it. However, not changing how we think about and teach economics leads us directly to Albert Einstein:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Finance"></category></entry><entry><title>Limited Competition in Sports</title><link href="https://adamnovotny.com/blog/limited-competition-in-sports.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-15T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2018-07-15T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Adam Novotny</name></author><id>tag:adamnovotny.com,2018-07-15:/blog/limited-competition-in-sports.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Freakonomics podcast titled &lt;a href="http://freakonomics.com/podcast/leicester-city/" target="_blank"&gt;The Longest Long Shot&lt;/a&gt; made me think about the benefits of competition.

The core of the podcast discussed the unbelievable title run by the Leicester City Football Club in the English Premier League in 2016. According to bookmakers who set the team’s odds to 5000–1 at the beginning of the season, it was the greatest underdog story in sports history. However, I came away thinking about the difference between “full competition” sports leagues such as the Premier League and what I call “limited competition” leagues such as the NBA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full competition leagues such as the Premier League have 3 main characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Struggling teams get relegated to lower leagues&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No draft picks are given; players are bought and sold in open market&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;No salary cap is imposed allowing teams to spend almost unlimited amounts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/theme/images/0*kUuFLf4l1vTfAs79.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/theme/images/0*kUuFLf4l1vTfAs79.png" alt="“Night view of crowded Volksparkstadion soccer stadium before the match at night” by Mario Klassen on Unsplash" style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limited competition leagues typically have the opposite characteristics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Guaranteed spot in the league next season regardless of performance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Draft picks to help poorly performing teams get the best youngest players for free&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Salary caps helping teams from smaller markets to compete&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/theme/images/0*zVrqAokLjb0ZE1__.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/theme/images/0*zVrqAokLjb0ZE1__.png" alt="Photo by JC Gellidon on Unsplash" style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An excellent example of the behavior induced by limited competition is the long-term &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leighsteinberg/2018/04/13/was-tanking-the-key-to-philadelphia-76ers-success/#122b47876d0a" target="_blank"&gt;tanking of NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers&lt;/a&gt;. Between 2012 and 2015 the team was managed to lose games to get valuable draft picks. Higher draft picks are given to struggling teams in the NBA. The league is effectively trying to raise the quality of the bottom teams while preventing the top teams from improving further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s worse, &lt;a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/23435394/philadelphia-76ers-future-bright-was-process-worth-nba" target="_blank"&gt;tanking seems to be working for the 76ers&lt;/a&gt;, which is likely to encourage other teams to follow the same strategy. Some fans will therefore watch terrible games of their home teams for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full competition in the Premier League encourages different behavior. In the season prior to winning the title, Leicester City was almost relegated and had to win 7 out of the 8 remaining games just to stay in the Premier League. I would argue that this improved the teams spirits and built a base for next year’s title success. In a limited competition league, the team would likely be losing games on purpose waiting for draft picks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interesting thing at the moment is that both models of competition seem to work. The popularity of full competition leagues represented by European soccer is increasing, as is that of limited competition leagues in the US such as NFL or NBA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the rules likely financially benefit different stakeholders. The list of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes%27_list_of_the_most_valuable_sports_teams" target="_blank"&gt;most valuable sports franchises in 2017&lt;/a&gt; is dominated by US limited competition teams. Only Manchester United, FC Barcelona, Real Madrid, and Bayern Munich representing full competition leagues crack the top 30. The value of teams from full competition leagues is lower due to no safety nets and the risk of relegation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limited competition rules likely cause a wealth transfer from the athletes to the owners. If US leagues changed their rules to full competition, some of the team owners’ wealth would likely land in the pockets of the athletes due to their better negotiating position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best examples are the recent transfers of the best athletes in basketball and soccer. The total cost of LeBron James from the perspective of the Los Angeles Lakers is &lt;a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/24052129/official-lakers-announce-lebron-james-signed" target="_blank"&gt;$153M&lt;/a&gt; over the next 4 seasons (or $38M per season). The cost of Christiano Ronaldo from the perspective of Juventus is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/10/cristiano-ronaldo-juventus-real-madrid" target="_blank"&gt;$400M&lt;/a&gt; (or $100 per season). To be fair, taxes and transfers fees are included so not all the money lands in Ronaldo’s pockets. However, Messi and Ronaldo from full competition leagues were among the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes%27_list_of_the_world%27s_highest-paid_athletes" target="_blank"&gt;top 3 highest paid athletes in 2016 and 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least since the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008" target="_blank"&gt;2008 financial crisis&lt;/a&gt;, the top line performance of economies and companies had been assumed to be real because inflation had been close to zero. Real was true both in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_gross_domestic_product" target="_blank"&gt;terms of economics&lt;/a&gt; and colloquially. People could depend on the figures because inflation was not blurring the results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the tide is changing based on individual accounts of businesses even though government statistics are slow to reflect it. This makes all government and private figures difficult to digest and the markets will need to adjust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example let’s take a world without inflation. If people are told that they are receiving a 10% wage raise, they have a reason to be happy and celebrate. However, in a world where inflation is a problem but its value is uncertain, a 10% wage rise is meaningless. A 5% inflation still implies people’s financial situation improves after the wage rise and they should celebrate, but a 20% inflation means people are worse off and the wage rise just lessens the pain. We just don’t know which inflationary world we are in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/theme/images/0*rW-82t_ucnT8St4U.png"&gt;&lt;img src="/theme/images/0*rW-82t_ucnT8St4U.png" alt="Photo by sergio souza on Unsplash" style="width: 100%" loading="lazy"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-aggregate individual accounts of people and companies are painting an inflationary picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything close to 3 percent is likely dangerous territory for central banks. I would argue that given the evidence below, government data have plenty of headroom to climb in order to reflect the experiences of private businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earnings commentary with data pointing to high or unexpected inflationary environment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;Casey General Store (CASY): The average retail price of fuel during this period increased over 13%.&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;q&gt;Darden Restaurants (DRI): Restaurant labor was 130 basis points unfavorable last year due to several factors…we continue to see elevated wage inflation of approximately 4%.&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;q&gt;Kirby (KEX): In the inland marine transportation business, we saw a positive change in market dynamics during the quarter. Spot market pricing increased approximately 10% to 15%.&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;q&gt;Patterson UTI (PTEN): Average rig operating costs per day were also higher-than-expected at $13,970, due primarily to higher-than-expected labor cost.&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;q&gt;Chipotle (CMG): The price increases averaged about 5% across the menu. Labor costs for the quarter were 27.8%, 90 basis points higher than last year. Wage inflation of 5%.&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;q&gt;Union Pacific (UNP): 5% improvement in average revenue per car drove a 7% increase in freight revenue.&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;q&gt;Domino’s Pizza (DPZ): … on food basket inflation, we’re still anchoring to the 2% to 4% for 2018.&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;q&gt;CH Robinson (CHRW): First, we are in a unprecedented freight environment. The healthy economy and rapid growth in e-commerce is driving a significant increase in the demand for freight. To illustrate this point, costs in our North America truckload business increased 21.5% this quarter, the largest single quarterly increase in our 21-year history as publicly traded company.&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;q&gt;KB Home (KBH): 7% increase in our overall average selling price.&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;q&gt;AO Smith (AOS): As a result of significantly higher steel prices and inflation in freight and other costs, we announced a price increase up to 12% on U.S. water heater products effective in early June.&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;q&gt;H.B. Fuller (FUL): We have three areas of focus as we enter the second quarter: first will be to realize over $50 million in annualized pricing to offset last year’s raw material inflation&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;q&gt;PotlatchDeltic (PCH): In general, I’d say costs are going up in trucking about 10% per year.&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;q&gt;Pulte Group (PHM): Our revenue growth for the period reflects the combination of a 10% or $38,000 increase in average sales price of $413,000.&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;q&gt;Lowe’s (LOW): We recently announced plans to expand our employee benefits and a one-time bonus of up to $1,000 for our more than 260,000 hourly employees in the U.S&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;q&gt;World Fuel Service (INT): Consolidated revenue is up 12% compared to the first quarter of 2017. This increase was principally due to a 22% year-over-year increase in oil prices.&lt;/q&gt;
&lt;q&gt;Brinker (EAT): … ongoing market-driven wage rate pressures which continued in the 3% to 4% range&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only data pointing to normal, expected inflation are based on lagging government data or structurally CPI-challenged countries such as Japan and Italy. Slower inflation data are perhaps calming the market now so its response remains relatively subdued. As soon as private business data starts leaking into government numbers significantly, I would expect a meaningful market response similar to that in February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It comes as no surprise given that many projects were attempted money grabs with white papers written over a weekend. Proven scams should be punished by authorities after the SEC clarifies which ICOs are securities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are [no ICOs] that I’ve seen that aren’t securities. &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sec-ico-tokens-regulated-securities-205650102.html?guccounter=1" target="_blank"&gt;SEC Chairman Clayton, April 26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC even set up a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-16/sec-tries-to-scam-ico-investors-to-show-them-how-easy-it-is" target="_blank"&gt;false ICO site&lt;/a&gt; asking investors for funds to prove how easy it is to scam investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, many ICO founders are just unrealistic about their ideas. Entrepreneurship requires a certain amount of unrealistic thinking to start a business and ignore all the risks and unknown unknowns. As long as they do not step over any securities bright lines, they should be supported and treated just like other entrepreneurs hopeful that their business succeeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to distinguish between ICO founders being delusional and fraudulent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not everything needs to have a blockchain. Most things don’t. Some projects will be transformative but building everything on top of a decentralized network makes no sense. Blockchain for streaming movies? Probably not necessary, Netflix seems to work just fine. But most ICO are likely not fraudulent either. They might just be a small part of the &lt;a href="https://www.fundera.com/blog/what-percentage-of-small-businesses-fail" target="_blank"&gt;70% of small businesses that fail within 10 years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Finance"></category></entry><entry><title>Why most ICOs are going to 0, and it’s not a big deal</title><link href="https://adamnovotny.com/blog/why-most-icos-are-going-to-0-and-its-not-a-big-deal.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-09-03T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2017-09-03T00:00:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Adam Novotny</name></author><id>tag:adamnovotny.com,2017-09-03:/blog/why-most-icos-are-going-to-0-and-its-not-a-big-deal.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;as long as people understand what they are buying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raising money using cryptocurrency issuance has become the new gold rush. Tezos has raised $200M+ and Bancor $100M+. There are hundreds of other completed raises and even more on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing to realize is that these are startups. And most startups fail. ICOs may be even riskier than your typical startup because they often can’t clear the conventional financing bar with angels and VCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even if I give ICOs the benefit of the doubt and call them conventional startup investments, most conventional startups fail. Angels and VCs know that most (say 90%) of early stage startups return nothing at all or nothing meaningful. And that’s not a problem as long as 10% of their investments are high flyers (the Amazons, Facebooks, and Googles of the world).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conventional startup market operates efficiently because investors understand the risk profile of their investments. Bad companies fail without affecting the rest so the winners can shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The danger with ICOs is that most buyers don’t realize what they are buying and as soon as 90% of investments fail, they will panic which may wipe out the 10% of potential successes as lawsuits and regulators join the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies raising money using ICOs should go above and beyond explaining to buyers the expected risk / reward profile of these investments.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Finance"></category></entry></feed>
