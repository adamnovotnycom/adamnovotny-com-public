            <p>This article calls on policy makers and voters in the United States to do the right thing and change the current state of the US immigration system. Some <strong>legal</strong> immigrants are treated as second class citizens which in my case destroyed the relationship with the only woman I ever loved.</p>
<p>I am finally able to reflect on some of the hardest moments of my life. It took for the Covid-19 pandemic to subside enough for me to have enough perspective to comprehend what was happening to me during the past 2 years.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the pandemic I spent the first 6 months in almost total isolation. There were no treatments, vaccines seemed years away, and watching people on TV sanitizing their Amazon boxes wasn't comforting for people like me without support system nearby.</p>
<p>To escape the isolation I traveled to visit another city and thanks to a complete miracle I met the love of my life. To protect her identity, I am going to call her Julie. I had to live in my original city due to visa restrictions but driving 8 hours almost every weekend to see her seemed so easy. Or as Clean Bandit &amp; Topic lyrics say</p>
<p><em><p style="text-align:center">When you find a love that's right</p></em>
<em><p style="text-align:center">You can drive all night</p></em></p>
<p>Visiting her apartment was my happy place almost every weekend. Julie was strong, independent, beautiful and had an amazing family she was close to. My admiration for her grew every time she mentioned she called her mom. </p>
<p>Every moment I spent with her I felt like I needed to prove I deserved her. We’d walk around Julie’s favorite parks, talk about our families and I started realizing that she is the most important person in my life. When the pandemic ends, I could see our future together. I’d have to wait until we can visit each other’s families but that would be just a formality.</p>
<p>However, after 4 months my physical health started failing me. The driving back and forth combined with stress from potentially losing my US visa left me exhausted. This resulted in my missing Valentine's day. Feeling sick, I also didn’t spend all of Easter with Julie which slowly started breaking her heart.</p>
<p>Julie offered to do the driving herself but I always felt like I had to show how serious I was about her by doing it myself. When I refused her visits to my apartment, I needed time to recover which naturally resulted in mistrust. What is he doing away on the weekends? she must have wondered. The last thing I wanted to admit was that I wasn’t feeling well. Some weekends I spent lying on my bed trying to recover enough energy to appear in good spirits next time I saw her. But I knew I looked distant. How do you explain that to the person you love the most?</p>
<p>Julie asked to travel more. She didn’t feel appreciated which made me struggle with the fact that I was failing her as her boyfriend. She said she was suffocating and I knew she deserved more excitement in her life. We have to live a little, she said, not knowing how much I needed her to feel alive. I no longer felt like I deserved her. But I knew that I was physically skating on thin ice. Even more driving and I would fall through the ice and drown. And I did. On our first and last trip.</p>
<p><strong>Why did my health fail me?</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. I was allowed to work remotely but not to move to a different city. Working a single day from a different city was a potential violation of immigration rules</strong></p>
<p>Work visa holders can work remotely but they have to stay in the same city. How does that make sense? Why should people be locked in their big city apartments just because that's where their offices were located? I was in touch with many friends stuck in New York City while their neighbors left for Florida. After talking to lawyers I was told that I can't move to Julie's city. For me that resulted in 1000s of miles of unnecessary driving, destroyed health, and mistrust.</p>
<p><strong>2. Travel bans were intended to hurt specific visa holders more</strong></p>
<p>My entire family lives in Europe and ever since my college graduation I felt like I needed to be extremely independent when living in the US because there would be no family member to call during emergencies. Being a guest in a foreign country such as the US is an amazing privilege, but it also creates long, dark shadows and my search for independence negatively changed my behavior. The fear of catching covid and not having support system nearby was paralyzing.</p>
<p>Due to my work visa I was treated differently than permanent residents or even international students who could travel internationally nearly without limits as far as the US was concerned. I was constantly checking on family members and dreading the moment when a family emergency in Europe would force me to travel and not be able to return. All of this stress was caused by special travel bans such as Presidential Proclamation 9993 which selectively targeted people <strong>legally</strong> working in the US.</p>
<p>Playing political football with peoples lives has to stop. There are many magnitudes more international students in US and yet the rules applying to them were much more tolerant. I personally know of two cases when people faced the impossible choice of not attending one of their parent's funeral abroad or leaving their loved ones in the US indefinitely. All of this because they had one type of visa and not another. As if the virus cared.</p>
<p><strong>3. Document renewals require international travel</strong></p>
<p>Working in the US on a visa during the pandemic was especially nerve-racking. I spent countless days researching what happens to my stay in the country I love in the case of layoffs. Either a person has to find employment within a few weeks or they have to leave the country permanently.</p>
<p>There was no coming back because US embassies abroad were not issuing new work visas. The extra pressure to maintain employment at the beginning of the pandemic was a struggle. Lost documents would also require international travel and a permanent departure.</p>
<p>My broken health led to a faithful FaceTime call when I said to Julie:</p>
<p><em><p style="text-align:center">You would better off without me</p></em></p>
<p>I cried that night. While I hoped the separation would be temporary, I also couldn’t give Julie any guarantees that I would be back with her because I didn’t understand my health. This broke her heart.</p>
<p>And then my health completely shattered. It turns out that seeing Julie was keeping me afloat. I was back in complete isolation for many months. Secretly, I hoped that she would visit but I was too embarrassed to ask. I spent weeks on antibiotics and visiting doctors to evaluate more serious conditions. I saw my dentist so frequently that he became my best friend. I didn’t leave the city I lived in until my next trip to see Julie too many months later.</p>
<p>Throughout this ordeal Julie and I exchanged many messages which always energized me. We talked on FaceTime. Even if just virtually, I tried to be supportive when her family member died. Somehow I felt our relationship continued even though I didn't deserve her and staying in a relationship would be selfish.</p>
<p>And then Russia invaded Ukraine. This is one of the scariest moments for any person with family in Eastern Europe. Growing up, this was always the most concerning topic of discussion. History may not repeat itself, but it rhymes. I finally recovered enough to travel but now I had to travel to Europe. I knew that if the war was to spread to Eastern Europe, I would have to volunteer in the military. Because if not me, then who?</p>
<p>Before I left for Europe I finally traveled to see Julie and apologized for leaving her in the dark. She seemed to accept the apology and even suggested that she might visit me when I come back. However, I had no idea what the war would bring. Out of fear of hurting her again, I was afraid to promise anything. I didn’t say what I felt</p>
<p><em><p style="text-align:center">I hope that you’ll wait for me</p></em></p>
<p>After a number of trips to Europe to support refugees now that travel rules were relaxed by new administration, I knew I was finally able to come back to the US more permanently. Completely sleep deprived I drove to see Julie directly from the airport. I slept for a few hours and woke up to new reality.</p>
<p>I came too late.</p>
<p><em><p style="text-align:center">I am sorry but I met a guy</p></em></p>
<p>I don’t remember the rest. </p>
<p>I tried to see her again but she was already living a different life. Her heart was too broken to give me a second chance. I even proposed because I thought we'd get married ever since our third date. I meant it and I still do. But she no longer looked like the person who would marry me. I will never know if she started seeing someone out of anger but that doesn't make a difference. The result is the same.</p>
<p>I didn’t communicate my health struggles during our relationship in part because I didn’t understand how they truly impacted my behavior. When I was myself I wouldn't let Julie walk on the side of the sidewalk near oncoming cars. If a car was to hit one of us, it better be me, I would say.</p>
<p>Towards the end, I wasn't that person anymore. The biggest victim was the only woman I ever loved. The woman I protected. The woman whose door I locked every time I left her apartment out of concern for her safety. The woman I refused to let drive to see me during winter because I would never forgive myself if something happened to her during those 8 hour trips.</p>
<p>My ask for policy makers is this: certain <strong>legal</strong> immigrants are battling with daily struggles just like everyone else. Do not create additional hurdles to make their lives even more challenging to win political points. Do not mistreat hardworking people following every rule of this country by introducing special proclamations. I invested 5 years of my life in an immigration status that I learned during the most challenging times was created for second class citizens.</p>
